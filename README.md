Project Title: Discord Community Skill Matcher
Project Description
This project aims to create a Discord bot that connects with Google Sheets and GitHub API to manage community members' skills, interests, and commitments. The bot will help users find and collaborate on projects based on their skillsets and preferences. It will also streamline project management and communication between community members.

Features
Google Forms Integration: Users fill out a Google Form to provide information about their skills, interests, and commitments. The bot will process the responses to match users with relevant projects or tasks.

Google Sheets Integration: The bot will store and manage user responses from Google Forms in a Google Sheet, enabling easy data processing and organization.

Role Management: The bot will assign custom roles to users based on their skills and interests, allowing for tailored access to different project areas within the Discord server.

GitHub API Integration: The bot will interact with the GitHub API, allowing users to manage and collaborate on GitHub projects directly from Discord.

User Authentication: Users will be able to link their GitHub accounts to their Discord profiles, granting the bot access to their GitHub data and enabling a seamless integration between the two platforms.

Project Management: The bot will provide project management features such as task creation, assignment, and progress tracking, enabling users to collaborate effectively within the Discord server.

Notifications and Updates: Users will receive notifications for relevant GitHub events, keeping them informed of project updates and fostering collaboration.

Collaboration and Networking: The bot will facilitate collaboration by matching users with complementary skills, fostering a vibrant and productive community.

User Onboarding: The bot will guide new users through the process of completing the Google Form and provide them with access to relevant resources based on their skills and interests.

Future Additions
Expanded Integration with External Services: Integrate additional APIs or services (e.g., Trello, Slack) to enhance the bot's functionality and streamline project management across platforms.

Data Visualization: Incorporate data visualization features, enabling users to generate graphs and charts based on project progress or other relevant metrics.

Advanced Reporting: Develop advanced reporting features to provide users with insights into project performance, team dynamics, and other essential aspects of project management.

Machine Learning-based Recommendations: Utilize machine learning algorithms to refine user matching and project recommendations, ensuring an increasingly tailored experience for community members.

Community Events and Activities: Expand the bot's functionality to include community events and activities, fostering engagement and collaboration among community members.

Conclusion
The Discord Community Skill Matcher aims to create a powerful tool for managing projects and fostering collaboration within a Discord community. By connecting Google Sheets, GitHub, and Discord, the bot will provide an integrated solution for organizing, managing, and tracking projects, ensuring that community members can focus on what they do best: collaborating and creating.
